# New RAPIER Module Ideas #

# Introduction #

RAPIER is completely modular by design.  In order to make RAPIER a more extensive tool, we need ideas for new modules to build.  Please add to this list.  Remember, RAPIER is a data gathering tool, not an analysis tool.  Analysis ideas will fall under DIRK, a project focused on taking RAPIER raw data and boiling out valuable information, however it is still in the very early planning stages.


# Details #

Modules to add to RAPIER 3.3:
  * **IISLogs** - captures the applicable IIS access and error logs
  * **ApacheLogs** - captures the applicable Apache access and error logs.  Note that since there is no default location for Apache, this might be hard to implement short of scanning the whole drive for logs
  * **Opera** - Opera web browser history and cookies
  * **Safari** - Safari web browser history and cookies
